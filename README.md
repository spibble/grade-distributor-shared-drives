# Grade Distributor for Shared Drives

![Grade Distributor logo](doc/grade-distributor.png)

Grade Distributor is a Google Sheets add-on for distributing grades from a single spreadsheet to individual spreadsheets for each student. This fork adds some small changes (mostly function rewrites and adding extra arguments to function calls where appropriate) to get around the extra permissions associated with Shared Drives on Google Drive.
